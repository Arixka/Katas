Will you make it?

You were camping with your friends far away from home, but when it's time to go back, you realize that your fuel is running out and the nearest pump is 50 miles away! You know that on average, your car runs on about 25 miles per gallon. There are 2 gallons left. Considering these factors, write a function that tells you if it is possible to get to the pump or not. Function should return true (1 in Prolog) if it is possible and false (0 in Prolog) if not. The input values are always positive.

Welcome!

Your start-up's BA has told marketing that your website has a large audience in Scandinavia and surrounding countries. Marketing thinks it would be great to welcome visitors to the site in their own language. Luckily you already use an API that detects the user's location, so this is an easy win.
The Task

    Think of a way to store the languages as a database (eg an object). The languages are listed below so you can copy and paste!
    Write a 'welcome' function that takes a parameter 'language' (always a string), and returns a greeting - if you have it in your database. It should default to English if the language is not in the database, or in the event of an invalid input.

Correct the mistakes of the character recognition software

Character recognition software is widely used to digitise printed texts. Thus the texts can be edited, searched and stored on a computer.

When documents (especially pretty old ones written with a typewriter), are digitised character recognition softwares often make mistakes.

Your task is correct the errors in the digitised text. You only have to handle the following mistakes:

    S is misinterpreted as 5
    O is misinterpreted as 0
    I is misinterpreted as 1

The test cases contain numbers only by mistake.
